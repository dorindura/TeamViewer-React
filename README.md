# Task Mangager

Learn React by implementing a Task Manager app alongside with your Frontend mentor as a part of **React** course from [SkillBrainÂ©](https://skillbrain.com/)

# How to

Clone this repository in the desired folder:

`git clone git@github.com:shapovalov-sasha/Task-Manager.git`

Navigate into project directory:

`cd Task-Manager`

Install by running:

`npm install`

When installation is done, start the project in development mode:

`npm start`

# Course structure

### Base code

The project has different branches corresponding to the module covered in video courses, each module having two branches.

- There are two types of branches which start with `<base>` or `<solution>`

ex.
`<base>-1.0-first-component-in-react` / `<solution>-1.0-first-component-in-react`

### Solution

The branch starting with `<base>` contains the final code at the end of the video course.
If you fail to track what the mentor is doing and have lost the thread, you can always check your code with the mentor's version to avoid getting stuck at this step.

Ensure you're on the right branch when working on a new feature. You can find the branch under the video course at [Class SkillBrain](https://class.skillbrain.com/).

### Before starting your work

Before starting your work, make sure you're on the right branch, and the version of the code is the last one(as it may change over time).

So at the start of each lesson, you should do the following steps:

- Launch the **VsCode** and open the project directory.
- Open a new terminal window, `Terminal > New Terminal`.
- Update the reference to remote branches:

  `git fetch --all`

  > The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.
  > **then**

  `git switch <branch name>`

  > The "switch" command allows you to switch your current HEAD branch. It's relatively new (added in Git v2.23) and provides a simpler alternative to the classic "checkout" command.

  **Example:**

  `git fetch --all`

  `git switch <base>-1.0-first-component-in-react`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
